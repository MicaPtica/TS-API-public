    "text": "Description of PPG data\nBelow is a detailed description of the PPG data and data structures used in the Teslasuit API for the PPG subsystem.\n\nHRV\n\nWhat is Heart Rate Variability (HRV)?\nHeart Rate Variability (HRV) is a measure of the variation in time between consecutive heartbeats. These time intervals, typically measured in milliseconds, reflect how the autonomic nervous system regulates the heart. HRV is widely recognized as a non-invasive marker of physiological resilience, stress response, and overall autonomic balance.\n\n\nWhy HRV Matters\nHRV provides insights into the balance between the sympathetic (“fight or flight”) and parasympathetic (“rest and digest”) branches of the autonomic nervous system. Higher HRV generally indicates better adaptability, recovery capacity, and health, while lower HRV can signal stress, fatigue, or underlying health issues.\n\n\nHRV in Teslasuit\nTeslasuit provides HRV analysis using various statistical and mathematical methods, including time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear approaches. These metrics provide different perspectives on how the body is responding and adapting over time. As calculation of different HRV parameters requires multiple R-R intervals, base for HRV calculations, Teslasuit has to make sufficient amount of measurements. Therefore the time buffer was implemented which makes impossible to get HRV data right after turning on the PPG sensor.\n\n\nHRV parameters and explanation\n\nMean R-R: The average time interval between consecutive heartbeats, measured in milliseconds. It reflects the average heart period and is inversely related to heart rate.\nStandard Deviation of NN Intervals (SDNN): A measure of overall heart rate variability, calculated as the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal RR intervals. It reflects both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and is influenced by total recording duration.\nStandard Deviation of Successive Differences (SDSD): The standard deviation of the differences between successive RR intervals. It reflects short-term variations in heart rate and is primarily influenced by parasympathetic activity.\nRoot Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD): A time-domain index of short-term heart rate variability. It is calculated as the square root of the mean squared differences between adjacent RR intervals and serves as a reliable indicator of parasympathetic (vagal) activity.\nSD1: A non-linear HRV metric representing short-term variability, derived from the width of the Poincaré plot (a scatter plot of RR intervals against the next RR interval). It is mathematically related to RMSSD.\nSD2: A measure of both short- and long-term variability, reflecting the length of the Poincaré plot ellipse. It captures the overall magnitude of variability and complements SD1.\nHigh-to-Low Frequency Ratio (HLF): The ratio between high-frequency and low-frequency spectral power in frequency-domain analysis. It provides an index of autonomic balance, with higher values indicating parasympathetic dominance and lower values suggesting sympathetic predominance.\n\n\n\n\nHeart Rate\n\nWhat is Heart Rate?\nHeart rate refers to the number of times the heart beats per minute (bpm). It is a direct indicator of cardiac activity and is influenced by a wide range of physiological and environmental factors, including physical exertion, emotional state, body temperature, and cardiovascular health. Heart rate is one of the most fundamental vital signs used in health and performance monitoring.\n\n\nWhy Heart Rate Matters\nHeart rate reflects the immediate state of the cardiovascular system and the body’s response to internal and external stimuli. An elevated heart rate may indicate physical effort, stress, or cardiovascular strain, while a lower heart rate at rest is often associated with good cardiovascular fitness and efficient autonomic function. Tracking heart rate over time allows for monitoring of exercise intensity, recovery, fatigue, and overall wellness.\n\n\nHeart Rate in Teslasuit\nTeslasuit measures heart rate using a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, which detects changes in vessels blood volume with each heartbeat. This allows for continuous, non-invasive monitoring of heart rate in both active and resting states. Heart rate data is updated in real-time and can be used independently or in combination with HRV metrics to assess physical performance, recovery, and autonomic nervous system activity.\n\n\nHeart Rate parameter and explanation\n\nHeart Rate (HR): The number of heartbeats per minute. It is calculated for every interval between successive heartbeats (R-R intervals) and reflects current cardiovascular activity. Heart rate increases with physical exertion or stress and decreases during rest or relaxation.\nis_valid: During periods of movement, signal artifacts may cause temporary disruptions or inaccuracies in heart rate measurements. To address this, we developed an extrapolation algorithm that maintains data continuity by estimating heart rate values when direct measurement is unreliable. As a result, each data point is accompanied by a validity flag indicating whether the value is based on a reliable measurement or an extrapolated estimate.",

    "text": "Description of Mocap Data\nBelow is a detailed description of the Mocap data and data structures used in the Teslasuit API for the Mocap subsystem.\n\nSkeleton Data\n\nWhat is Skeleton Data?\nThe “Skeleton” refers to a skeletal model—a digital representation of the human body composed of interconnected bones or segments—that mirrors the subject’s posture and motion in real time. Skeleton data represents the positions and orientations of bones in a 3D space. It is used to track the movement of a subject’s body and is a fundamental component of motion capture systems.\n\n\nWhy Skeleton Data Matters\nSkeleton data provides insights into body posture, joint movements, and overall motion patterns. It is widely used in animation, sports analysis, and rehabilitation to study and replicate human motion.\n\n\nSkeleton Data in Teslasuit\nThe Teslasuit provides detailed skeleton data using its integrated motion capture sensors. This data includes the position and rotation of each bone in the body, enabling precise motion tracking and analysis.\n\n\nSkeleton Data Parameters and Explanation\n\nPosition: The 3D coordinates (x, y, z) of a bone in space.\nRotation: The orientation of a bone represented as a quaternion (w, x, y, z).\n\n\nWhat is a Quaternion?\nA quaternion is a mathematical representation used to describe rotations in 3D space. It consists of four components: one real part (w) and three imaginary parts (x, y, z). Quaternions are widely used in computer graphics, robotics, and motion capture because they avoid issues like gimbal lock and provide smooth interpolation for rotations.\n\n\n\n\nBiomechanical Angles\n\nWhat are Biomechanical Angles?\nBiomechanical angles represent the relative angles between bones at joints. These angles are used to analyze joint movements and body mechanics.\n\n\nWhy Biomechanical Angles Matter\nBiomechanical angles provide valuable information about joint flexibility, posture, and movement efficiency. They are essential for applications in sports performance, rehabilitation, and ergonomics.\n\n\nBiomechanical Angles in Teslasuit\nTeslasuit calculates biomechanical angles using its motion capture data. These angles are available for key joints in the body and can be used to analyze motion patterns and detect abnormalities.\n\n\nBiomechanical Angle Parameters and Explanation\n\nJoint Angle: The angles between two connected bones at a joint. Angles are typically measured in degrees or radians and represent the relative orientation of the bones.\n\nFlexion/Extension: These angles describe the bending (flexion) or straightening (extension) of a joint. For example, the knee joint’s flexion angle increases as the leg bends.\nAbduction/Adduction: These angles describe the movement of a limb away from (abduction) or toward (adduction) the body’s midline. For example, raising an arm sideways involves abduction of the shoulder joint.\nInternal/External Rotation: These angles describe the rotation of a bone around its longitudinal axis. For example, rotating the forearm inward or outward involves internal or external rotation of the shoulder joint.\nPlane of Movement: The biomechanical angles are often categorized based on the anatomical planes of movement:\n\nSagittal Plane: Flexion and extension.\nFrontal Plane: Abduction and adduction.\nTransverse Plane: Internal and external rotation.",

    "text": "The Teslasuit SDK is a developer toolkit for integrating the Teslasuit — a full-body haptic suit with motion capture and biometric sensors — into immersive applications. With this SDK, developers can control the suit’s haptic feedback system, stream and record motion data, and monitor biometric signals in real time.\nThe Teslasuit SDK Python API provides a high-level interface for integrating Teslasuit systems into Python-based applications. It enables developers, researchers, and engineers to access the full range of Teslasuit’s haptic, motion capture, and biometric capabilities through an efficient and extensible API.\n\n\n\nThe API documentation is organized into the following sections:\n\nGetting Started – Fast setup for quick first steps\nMain Concepts – Theory and architecture of Teslasuit systems\n\nAPI Reference\n\nCore – Initialization, connection, session control\n\nSubsystems – Haptics, Mocap, Biometry, Mapping, etc.\n\n\nExamples – Step-by-step usage scripts\n\nUse Cases – Practical applications and integration flows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Haptics module allows you to control the suit’s network of electrical stimulators to create realistic tactile feedback or stimulate major muscle groups to elicit contractions. Developers can configure custom stimulation patterns, adjust intensity levels, and trigger feedback events in sync with application logic.\nFor example, you might simulate the feeling of impact or rainfall on the user’s body, or provide a complex stimulation pattern across multiple muscle groups in the lower extremities, synchronized with the gait cycle.\n➡️ Create your first haptic touch.\n🔍 Learn more about the suit’s EMS system and best practices for designing haptic feedback here.\n\n\n\n\nThe Motion Capture module provides access to the suit’s built-in IMU-based inertial tracking system. The SDK streams detailed motion and biomechanical data in real time, using a skeletal model to deliver full-body pose tracking.\nFor example, you can animate a game character using real-time body motion, record physical activity for replay or analysis, or dynamically adjust stimulation based on biomechanical feedback.\n➡️ Start your first motion capture stream.\n🔍 Learn more about Teslasuit’s Mocap system, coordinate systems, and best practices here.\n\n\n\n\nThe Biometry module provides real-time biometric readings from the suit’s sensors to monitor the user’s physical state. With the Python API, developers can access data such as heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV), offering insights into stress, fatigue, or exertion levels.\nFor instance, an adaptive training application can adjust difficulty or feedback based on a user’s physiological response.\n➡️ Measure your heart rate now.\n🔍 Learn more about Teslasuit’s biometric system and HRV metrics here.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the Teslasuit SDK Python API, ensure you have:\n\nWindows 10 or later\n\nInstalled Teslasuit Control Center\nPython 3.8 or higher\n\nA connected Teslasuit device\n\n\n\n\n\nFor technical inquiries, feature requests, or troubleshooting assistance, please contact:\n\nHelp Desk\n\nFAQ\n\nDeveloper Forum\n\nEmail support: support@teslasuit.io",
