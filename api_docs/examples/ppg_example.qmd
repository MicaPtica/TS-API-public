title: "Example PPG"

## Intro
This is an example of how to get data from the PPG sensor of your device

## Example with code
Import of necessary libs
```python
from teslasuit_sdk import ts_api
import teslasuit_sdk.subsystems.ts_ppg
```
```python
def main():
    print("Initialize API")
```
    Creating and initializing the instance of Teslasuit API
```python
    api = ts_api.TsApi()
```
    Get a connected Teslasuit device or waits until a device is attached if not already connected
```python
    device = api.get_device_manager().get_or_wait_last_device_attached()
```
    Access the PPG  subsystem of the device
```python
    ppg = device.ppg
    

    print("Wait for ppg data...")
```
    Starting the streaming of a raw PPG data
```python
    ppg.start_raw_streaming()
```
    While alive, wait until getting a HRV data and then prints it
```python
    while True:
        data = ppg.get_hrv_data_on_ready()
        print("Mean R-R:", data.mean_rr)
```
